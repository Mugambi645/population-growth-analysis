# population-growth-analysis

This code builds a population prediction system using polynomial regression. It loads historical population data (1960–2021) and country names, then provides a Streamlit dashboard where users select a country and input a year. If valid, the app trains a regression model to predict that country's population for the selected year, displays the prediction with model accuracy (R² score), and visualizes both historical and predicted values using Plotly, marking the prediction with a star.
